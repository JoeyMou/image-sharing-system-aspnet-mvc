Image Sharing System (asp.net mvc)
====================

This is actually a project for the course -- CS526 Enterprise and Cloud Computing, in which we're asked to finish a project by aspnet.mvc because the instructor says it is very convenient to use(I like nodejs more..). 

Anyway, I'll keep learning it.

======Update========

After one semester's study, finally finished the project. Now it's running on Microsoft Azure.
